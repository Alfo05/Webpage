          <p class="white-text">The History of the Italian nation begins in 1861, why so late? one might ask since the italian peninsula has been an integral part of history, well after the fall of the Roman Empire italy was left occupied by the Ostrogoths then by the byzantines and then by the Holy roman Empire after the HRE's collapse italy became divided into different states that would have their own golden age such as the Venetian merchant republic, the Genoese Republic, The Kingdom of Sicily and most important of all the Papal States. <br>
            <br>this divided peninsula would face many challanges as every european power wanted a piece of italy and many would like spain in the south and france and austria in the north but this would change with the napoleonic wars and its effects on europe most importantly the age of Revolutions which set Europe ablaze this led to calls for unification of peoples throught europe <br>
            <br>in italy the age of revolutions led to the Risorgimiento which means the Rising this movement called for all italian peoples to be united under a single banner, while many attempted to unite italy the ones that succeded were the Kingdom of Sardinia Piedmont under the house of Savoy but they could not do it without the Risorgimiento's biggest supporter Guiseppe Garibaldi </p>
