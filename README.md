# Webpage
for this webpage i have created a brief guide on italy including a brief summary of its history leading up to World war 2 and places i would reccomend to visit and food to try
for this webpage it has not been as difficult as it had been previously for me due to the fact that this is the third time i make a webpage but that does not mean that i did not run into some problems one of them was the organization and paths somthing i had ran into previously which is that copying the relative path would not make it so the formating would not appear this i have corrected by adding ..\ before the paths which allows for them to be called upon outside the local repository. another issue i have ran into is regarding the net page where i asked my classmates to send their website links to me since we are supposed to put 4 links but only 1 of my classmates responded and sent their link.
