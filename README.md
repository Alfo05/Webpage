# Webpage
for this webpage i have created a brief guide on italy including a brief summary of its history leading up to World war 2 and places i would reccomend to visit and food to try
for this webpage it has not been as difficult as it had been previously for me due to the fact that this is the third time i make a webpage but that does not mean that i did not run into some problems one of them was the organization and paths somthing i had ran into previously which is that copying the relative path would not make it so the formating would not appear this i have corrected by adding ..\ before the paths which allows for them to be called upon outside the local repository. another issue i have ran into is regarding the net page where i asked my classmates to send their website links to me since we are supposed to put 4 links but only 3 of my classmates responded and sent their link. another roadblock was an error i made when adding the links to the websites where i forgot to specify the path in the index since when working in the public folder you didnt need to specify the folder i simply put it as it was but upon checking the webpage it came up as Error 404 which led me to re check the code and see that i hade made a silly mistake.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, creating a webpage for this assignment was not as challenging as it was last year as i have been able to pull from past experiences to correct any mistakes i hade previously made and making the Webpage has been easier due to that as the past challenges have shaped how my websites have changed and grown.
